# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately:
- Open a GitHub issue with minimal details and request a private channel, or
- Reach out via OpenClaw Discord.

We will respond as soon as possible.
